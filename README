This is a C port of the google snappy compressor (http://code.google.com/p/snappy/)
The compressor is very fast with reasonable compression ratio.
It is mainly useful for projects that cannot integrate C++ code, but want snappy.
Also contains a command line tool, a benchmark, random test code and a fuzz tester.
